## Building

To build the app on GNU+Linux, clone the repository and run

``` ./gradlew build ```

in the root directory.

Use

``` ./gradlew installDebug ```

to install the app on a connected device.

## How it works

Red Moon displays a constant transparant overlay to dim and color the
screen when the filter is on. If, for example, you have the intensity
set to 0%, then the overlay will be black with a transparency equal to
the dim level you selected. If you choose a higher intensity, the
color will be saturated with the selected color.
